# This Launcher was DISCONTINUED, because the NEW Official Eve-Launcher has all the Features this one was implementing

IT WORKS THROUGH (FOR NOW), because eve launcher is still bad. Didn't allow to accept EULA today. So I updated my own to get into eve.
Might update this one to support new features now actually.


# PveLauncher
A simple python eve launcher, supporting Two Factor Authentication and Evepath per account

### Features

 * TwoFactor Authentification
 * Mail Code support
 * Update check
 * Serverstatus (using eve api)
 * Eve Path per Account
 * Encrypted passwords (password for encryption can be set using a command line option, or defaults to a static one)
